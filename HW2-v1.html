		Beating video games incredibly slowly has been an informal pastime for as long as beating video games insanely quickly an informal pastime. 
		Online communities started springing up in the mid-'90s around "slow-running" certain games, notably first-person shooters Doom and Quake, but computer 
		storage and bandwidth limitations constrained the subculture's growth. However, as Moore's Law continued to hold through the early oughts, and people no 
		longer had to leave their computers on overnight to download a 10-minute MPEG video, "slow-running" as it would be known started to attract a larger following. 
		At the beginning of the 2010s, two complementary developments brought video game slow-running into the mainstream: the maturation of YouTube and the advent of Twitch. 
		Runners could live-stream runs on Twitch, then upload the footage to YouTube and wait for those sweet, sweet recommendation algorithms to kick in whenever one of its billion 
		users searches a phrase like "how to beat super mario world." Runners had spent decades building a community; now they had an audience.

        <p>   
        Games Done Slow is a series of charity video game marathons. These events feature high-level gameplay by slow-runners raising money for charity. 
		In these events slow-runners take turns demonstrating their prowess at beating various video games in the slowest possible time, done in front of an 
		audience as well as a livestream through Twitch.tv. Sometimes these runs may be executed in an unusual or specific way, such as fully completing every level, 
		completing a game blindfolded, or featuring multiple runners racing against one another to complete a game last.Video games run in Games Done Slow events include both 
		retro and modern titles. The runs typically feature commentary from the runner(s) or experienced commentators, as well as donation messages read by an announcer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Most of the popular runs feature video game glitches and discussion between the runner and the commentators, most frequently describing techniques or using observational
		humor and banter. Humor and banter is especially used for non-interactive or repetitive sequences that don't require the runner to use much or any skill. Donations from viewers
		may feature humorous comments that contain inside jokes among the slow-running community, as well as more personal acknowledgements concerning the charity donated to. To date, 
		Games Done Slow has raised over 19.3 million dollars for charity. We also average over 2000 people in attendance at our events, including staff, volunteers, runners, and attendees 
		just looking to have fun and support the event!
